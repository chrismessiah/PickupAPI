13	The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.\n\nWell, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.\n\nWell, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot.

But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.\n\nDo you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.	Samuel L. Ipsum
14	What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part - through protests and struggle, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk - to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time. I've gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the world's poorest nations. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean. To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, and to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, and recognize Israel's right to exist.\n\nI learned that everyone's got a sacred story when you take the time to listen. Because it's not who we are. Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. Not with so much work to be done.\n\nBecause whether it's poverty or racism, the uninsured or the unemployed, war or peace, the challenges we face today are not simply technical problems in search of the perfect ten-point plan. No, the word is very near. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.\n\nThat is the true genius of America - a faith in simple dreams,, an insistence on small miracles. That we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe. But we also know that government initiatives are not enough. This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work. And any nation - including Iran - should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nThis time we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for men and women of every race, and the homes for sale that once belonged to Americans from every religion, every region, every walk of life. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough." I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. It is time for these settlements to stop. The same is true for the astonishing progress within Muslim-majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai.\n\nThank you very much everybody.	Obama Ipsum
